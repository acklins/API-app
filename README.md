 Your User stories – who are your users, what do they want and why?

 Some of my users may not know what the words api, git, search or magnifying glass icon mean. And other users will be exceptionally brilliant at all of the technologies used;
-My users all want to enter a word in the search field, press submit and see data displayed in the results section.

 Descriptions of any Unsolved problems or major hurdles I had to overcome:
 1) how to write DRY functions in js.
 2) knowledge leveling up on logic, DOM, event listener and functions.
 3) how to use template literals in js code to display the selected json.
 4) how to implement the clear function and still deciding on most efficient data removal.
 5) how to remove target via useage of firstChild, nextChild, lastChild(prevChild).
 6) overall aesthetics and patient usage of CSS to overcome those hurdles.
 7) media query to handle the api list(li) display on mobile.
